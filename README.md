# Assignment 9

In this assignment I have used assignment 8 API endpoints and integrated it with Frontend to authenticate user.

## API

endpoint: /user/verify

This API verifies if user credentials are correct or not, and returns message.

## Frontend

In frontend I have created 4 components:

Home: Consists all other components

About: Inside Home component. Displays card and some about information

Jobs: Inside Home component. Displays dynamic cards based on data written in js file.

Contact: Inside Home component. Displays card with some form fields

Login: login page opens first when we start the application. If user entered password are correct it will navigate to the home page.


## React-Router-DOM

Used to link different page

## Folder Structure
Both in frontend and Backend code, given folder structure is followed.

Frontend is divided as per pages all the pages are in different files. And backend is also divided in models, controllers, services and routes.
